OutStem Back-End Challenge- Frank's Workshop 2.0

I've created the Database using PostgreSQL and the UI is created using VB.NET using Visual Studio 2013
The app currently runs by cloning the code and opening the solution file on Visual Studio 2013. From there run it on any browser such as google chrome. Currently the only functionality is being able to click the view recipes button.
At the moment the only way to view the tables is to run the provided code on PgAdmin, they are not currently linked. I've created the two tables with the specified constraints and provided sample data.
This was an opportunity for me to apply my previous knowledge of SQL learn to use PostgreSQL for the first time.
