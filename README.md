OutStem Back-End Challenge- Frank's Workshop 2.0

I've created the Database using PostgreSQL and the UI is created using VB.NET
The app currently does not run. I've created the two tables with the specified constraints and a basic UI for the main page. I've not had the chance to link the two. This was an opportunity for me to apply my previous knowledge of SQL learn to use PostgreSQL for the first time.
